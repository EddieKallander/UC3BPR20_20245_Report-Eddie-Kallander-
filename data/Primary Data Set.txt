The dataset that was used for this research was Internet Background Radiation (IBR) traffic that has
been captured by a Network Telescope operated on the SANREN Network by The National Integrated
Cyber Infrastructure System (NICIS). The dataset was provided by Professor Barry Irwin. The data was provided as PCAP data files.

The primary ethical consideration that was taken into account was ensuring that the monitored range
of the network telescope were not disclosed.

There was no foreseen risks in the data set and/or data processing.
