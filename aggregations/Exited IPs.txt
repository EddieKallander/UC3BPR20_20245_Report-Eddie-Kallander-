These aggregation were used to count the last time a source IP were observed.

Monthly basis:
IF { FIXED [Source IP]: MAX(DATETRUNC('month', [Fixed Timestamp])) } = DATETRUNC('month', [Fixed Timestamp])
THEN [Source IP] 
END

Daily basis:
IF { FIXED [Source IP]: MAX(DATETRUNC('day', [Fixed Timestamp])) } = DATETRUNC('day', [Fixed Timestamp])
THEN [Source IP] 
END
