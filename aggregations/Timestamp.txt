This expression were used to properly handlethe number of digits in the timestamps microseconds, as tableau did not acknowledge this by default.

Fixed Timestamp:
IF LEN(TRIM([Timestamp])) >= 21 THEN
    DATETIME(TRIM([Timestamp]))

ELSEIF LEN(TRIM([Timestamp])) = 19 THEN
    DATETIME(LEFT(TRIM([Timestamp]), 19))

ELSEIF LEN(TRIM([Timestamp])) < 19 THEN
    // Handle timestamps that are too short (possible data corruption)
    NULL

ELSE
    DATETIME(TRIM([Timestamp]))
END
