These LOD expressions were used to categorize source as either Rgular or transient.

First a Churn was calculated based on the number of days a source was observed.
Churn Score:
{ FIXED [Source IP]: COUNTD(DATETRUNC('day', [Fixed Timestamp])) } / 
{ FIXED : COUNTD(DATETRUNC('day', [Fixed Timestamp])) }

Then a Dynamic Threshold were extracted, based on the Calulcated Churn Score Mean and Standard deviation.
Dynamic Threshold:
{ FIXED : AVG([Churn Score]) } + 1 * { FIXED : STDEV([Churn Score]) }

If the Churn score of the source were greater than or equal to the Dynamic Treshold it was categorized as Regular.
Categorization:
IF [Churn Score] >= [Dynamic Threshold] THEN "Regular" ELSE "Transient" END
